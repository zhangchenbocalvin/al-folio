I am student at *ETH Zurich* pursuing an *MSc in Data Science* in the Department of Computer Science, with a focus on machine learning and statistics. I am currently also working as a software developmer and machine learning researcher at *Aios*, an early-stage startup which aims to implement a new EdTech platform to construct a better education for future generations.

Before my masters, in June 2021, I completed a *BSc (Honours) in Computer Science and Mathematics* at the *University of Manchester*, in the UK, achieving a first class degree. I completed my final project on *"Adversarial Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Agents for Atari Games"* under the supervision of Dr. *Tingting Mu*.

During my undergraduate degree, in the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a software engineer at *Axyon AI*, a FinTech startup which employs deep learning solutions for asset management. In the summer of 2020, I worked under the supervision Dr. *Tingting Mu* and Dr. *Christoforos Moutafis* as a undergraduate research student to investigate the use of machine learning techniques to analyze the bahavior of quasi-particles called skyrmions.
